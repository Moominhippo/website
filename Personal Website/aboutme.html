            Hello fellow learners, and welcome to Beauty and the Brain, where you can be a beauty and a brain. My name is Lene, and I am
            the creator of the Beauty and the Brain educational website. I am currently studying a Master of Neuroscience and have a 
            background in biomedical sciences. I started this personal project because in my personal experiences throughout life around
            observations I have made of those around me, I believe that we need to make learning fun and exciting again rather than 
            a place of stress and anxiety. This is why I have described what I believe are "the four learning types", however this is 
            of course not something scientifically proven, but I thought it might be helpful to see that there are many ways we can 
            approach learning in a way that suits us best. As a discussor-teacher myself, I am excited to learn along the way with those 
            of you who find the material helpful. I am also excited to share what I have learned and hopefully be of help to others 
            studying biology and neuroscience, as well as academic writing.
