        <h1 class="heading">What is your learning type?</h1>
        
        <div class="container">
        <p>
            There are four different learning type combinations that I have grouped together as archetypes.
            When I ask the question "what is your learning type?" I do not mean "how do you usually go about learning?"
            This is because each one of us has reacted to learning in stressful situations trying to meet deadlines,
            not fully understanding what the teacher said, or not understanding the homework. All of us have had struggles
            with learning and because of this, we end up doing what we are most comfortable with to get by rather than
            be excited to challenge ourselves. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So, when I ask "what is your learning type?" what I am really asking is "how would you learn if you did not
            feel obligated to get by? How would you learn if you challenged yourself? How would you learn for fun?" I myself
            would identify as a "discussor and teacher" which is precisely why I made this website because I want to make
            learning something fun and exciting again.
        </p>

        <h2>The Gatherer and Discussor</h2>
    
        <p>
            If you are a gatherer and discussor, you are most likely stuck in the "processor-teacher" learning style. At school, to
            get by in classes, you constantly try to relate any new information to what you already know and explain it to others. You feel
            like you do not have the time to explorer new information or subjects and feel like its best to stick with the subjects you 
            have always done. You are afraid of making mistakes because if you fail now, you will feel like you fell behind.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you did not feel this pressure to perform and teach your knowledge to others, if you did not fear that you would fall
            behind if you tried something new, if you were not afraid to have your current knowledge challenged by other perspectives,
            you would have the most fun as a gatherer-discussor. You were born to be an explorer, if only the world were not such
            an unpredictable place, if only we were not shamed for not knowing. You want to step out of your comfort zone
            and take in new ideas, new information, new experiences. On your quest of knowledge you would discuss with others, and 
            feel thrilled by their points of view, feel like your opinion is valued, and find joy in problem solving together as a team. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Processor and Teacher</h2>

        <p>
            If you are a processor and teacher, you are most likely stuck in the "gatherer-discussor" learning style. At school, to get 
            by in classes, you constantly ask questions to others and try to find new information or another video on YouTube to
            go through the same math problem in a different way because "maybe then I will finally understand!" The problem is that
            no matter how many questions you ask or how many videos you find, you never feel like you have a true grasp on any
            particular subject matter, but just enough to get through to the next class. You feel like you do not have time to
            process the information on your own or figure out how to explain it to someone else.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you did not feel the pressure of time and needing to move onto the next thing, if you did not feel the fear of not having 
            all the qualifications because you are not sure what you are good at or what you want, if you were not afraid of committing
            to something because "what if something better is around the corner?" you would have the most fun learning as a 
            processor-teacher. You were born for mastery, if only the world were patient enough to allow you to focus. You find
            excitement and joy in the "light-bulb" moments, when you understood something on your own. You find it rewarding
            when you are able to work on your favourite subject all day on your own and become the specialist of knowledge
            in this particular area that other people are confident enough in your knowledge to be led by you and listen to your
            answers.   
        </p>

        <h2>The Discussor and Teacher</h2>

        <p>
            If you are a discussor and teacher, you are most likely stuck in the "gatherer-processor" learning style. At school, to get
            by in classes, you feel a constant stress about the workload and you could just have a moment to yourself you could get it 
            all finished. You feel like you do not have time to discuss with others and feel worried that you do not know or understand
            enough to be able to explain your knowledge to others in an clear and concise way. You are afraid that other people do not 
            care or find the subjects you enjoy important or interesting. You are afraid of appearing incompetent. You feel like you 
            are in a constant state of finding new information and trying to process and are afraid to ask questions. You feel like
            if the workload would stop piling and find the motivation to continue, you would finally have the time to organize 
            the information to discuss your ideas and share your knowledge with others.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you did not feel the pressure of time forcing you to learn and process the next thing before you feel ready to discuss
            with others and teach others what you have learned, if you did not feel the pressure to get the information just right 
            for yourself to feel competent, you would have the most fun learning as a discussor-teacher. Of all the learning types, 
            the discussor-teacher sounds the most counter-intuitive. However, discussor-teachers will find that by discussing and practicing
            teaching, they will become more confident in their knowledge and feel like they have finally learned the information. You were
            born for teaching. If only the world would actually be patient and listen and accept your help. You find it rewarding
            to contribute to problem solving with a team and that people are confident in your knowledge enough to be led by you around
            listen to your answers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Gatherer and Processor</h2>

        <p>
            If you are a gatherer and processor, you are most likely stuck in the "discussor-teacher" learning style. At school, to get by
            in classes, you feel a constant pressure to learn what is expected of you from others and feel pulled to help others get by. You
            often ask questions to others when you are trying to learn and also try to share your knowledge when you can. The problem is 
            that you feel like you are constantly pulled away from your own interests and like you only learn for others and not simply
            for your own enjoyment. You feel like you do not have the time to explore and process what it is important to you. If only 
            people would stop placing demands on you and give you the space to learn what interests you. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If you did not feel the pressure of others demands and requests, you would have the most fun learning as a gatherer-processor. 
            You would feel the freedom to learn at your pace and do it your way. You were a born investigator, if only the world would leave
            you alone and trust you to do things your way. You find meaning and purpose from within. You find it rewarding when you are able to
            focus on learning something and feel satisfied when you have the freedom to perform at the level and quality you desire. You also
            feel excited when you see something new that catches your interest and happy when you feel like you are in control of when you 
            have time to learn new things or focus on building your knowledge in a specific area. You feel more appreciated and 
            confident in yourself when your leaders trust and value your opinions and way of doing things.
