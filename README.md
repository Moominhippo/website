# Educational/Portfolio Website

Hello! Currently, I am creating a website to host my scientific writing portfolio which will also be an educational website. My goal is to make learning fun and teach biology and neuroscience. I have also used this as an opportunity to teach myself HTML, CSS and hopefully some JavaScript later down the line.
